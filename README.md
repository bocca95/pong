# PONG GAME

Hey everyone! I've been learning game development in C++ with SFML and decided to create a game inspired by the iconic PONG. The code isn't 100% complete yet, as I plan to add more features in the future. Parts of the code are also in Brazilian Portuguese because it's my native language, but I intend to translate it to English later. Any feedback is welcome!

Update 1:
- Variables, comments translated to english;
- Uploaded pong_game.exe;

Update 2:
- Paddle Collision and Ball Velocity issues fixed;
